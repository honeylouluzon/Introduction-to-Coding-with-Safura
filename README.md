# Introduction to Coding with Safura (Python Practice Projects)

This repository contains a collection of coding sessions and assignments designed to build foundational Python skills. Each session covers a different topic, ranging from control flow and functions to modules, APIs, and regular expressions. Exercises include both structured assignments and optional challenges to deepen your understanding.


SESSION II: Control Flow (If, Else, and Loops)
	•	Assignments:
	•	Check if a number is even or odd.
	•	Implement the classic “FizzBuzz” challenge.
	•	Optional Easy Tasks:
	•	Generate a multiplication table.
	•	Calculate the sum of digits.
	•	Reverse a number (displayed horizontally and vertically).
	•	Count the digits in numbers, including decimals.
	•	Print a right-angled triangle pattern.
	•	Optional Hard Tasks:
	•	Simulate list operations with random commands.
	•	Solve the Two Sum problem.
	•	Check if a number is a palindrome.


SESSION III: Functions and Code Reusability
	•	Create and invoke custom functions to perform various operations.
	•	Tasks include:
	•	Calculating factorials (with both formula representation and result).
	•	Checking for palindromes with explanatory output.
	•	Computing squares of numbers for both integer and floating-point input.
	•	Determining prime numbers.
	•	Performing exponentiation.
	•	Generating Fibonacci numbers (both the nth number and the full sequence).


SESSION IV: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries)
	•	Homework Tasks:
	•	Filter and sort numbers in lists.
	•	Swap tuple elements.
	•	Count word frequencies in a sentence while ignoring punctuation and case.
	•	Merge dictionaries by summing the values of common keys.
	•	Find the most frequent number in a list.


SESSION V: Strings and String Manipulation
	•	Reverse a string.
	•	Count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.


SESSION VI: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
	•	Define classes with methods for performing operations.
	•	Topics include:
	•	Creating a Person class with an introductory method.
	•	Designing a Car class to display its details.
	•	Implementing an Animal base class with Dog and Cat subclasses showcasing unique characteristics.


SESSION VII: File Handling
	•	Work with text files to:
	•	Write and read multiple sentences.
	•	Count words and lines.
	•	Manipulate file content through reading and writing exercises.


SESSION VIII: Modules and Packages
	•	Learn how to import and utilize modules from the standard library (such as math functions).
	•	Understand how to structure projects with packages.
	•	Explore using external libraries and organizing code for reusability.


SESSION IX: Working with API
	•	Practice handling APIs by:
	•	Fetching data from online services.
	•	Parsing JSON data.
	•	Simulating API calls and processing responses.
	•	Displaying extracted information in a user-friendly format.


SESSION X: Regular Expressions (Regex)
	•	Master the fundamentals of pattern matching in Python.
	•	Work on exercises to:
	•	Validate and extract data such as email addresses and phone numbers.
	•	Perform string search and manipulation using regex.
	•	Solve practical problems involving text extraction and data cleanup.


Notes

This collection of sessions is ideal for beginners or anyone looking to refresh their Python knowledge. Each session builds on previous concepts, progressively introducing more complex ideas while encouraging hands-on problem solving. Enjoy the journey, and feel free to explore and modify the tasks to suit your learning pace!
